# AppleAuthenticationWrapper

<p align="center">
ℹ️ Wrapper for quick authorization with Apple Sign In
</p>

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `AppleAuthenticationWrapper` in action. Simply open the `AppleAuthenticationWrapper.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/moslienko/AppleAuthenticationWrapper.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `AppleAuthenticationWrapper`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate AppleAuthenticationWrapper into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage

Init wrapper class:

```swift
let authWrapper = AppleAuthenticationWrapper()
```

Checking if the user is logged:

```swift
func checkAuthStatus(userID: String, authorized: (() -> Void)?, notAuthorized: (() -> Void)?)
```

After successful authorization, you can immediately get a token and nonce:

```swift
authWrapper.signInViaApple(
    from: self,
    requestedScopes: [.email, .fullName],
    successAuth: { credential in
        print("Success auth, token \(credential.token), nonce - \(authWrapper.currentNonce)")
    },
    failedAuth: { error in
        print("Failed auth: \(String(describing: error?.localizedDescription))")
    }
)
 ```
